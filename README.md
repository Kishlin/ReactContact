Contact app using React and Firebase.

[Try this app live](https://kishlin.github.io/ReactContact/).

This project uses a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) Database. If you want to make it run locally, you'll have to copy ./constants/.AppConstants.js and update it with your own Firebase credentials.
